# Binary Search

## intro
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target element within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## How Binary Search Works
- Start with two pointers, low and high, representing the search bounds.
- Compute the middle index, mid = (low + high) // 2.
- Compare the target value with the element at the middle index:
- If the target equals the middle element, return its index.
- If the target is less than the middle element, narrow the search to the left half by setting high = mid - 1.
- If the target is greater than the middle element, narrow the search to the right half by setting low = mid + 1.
- Repeat until low > high or the target is found.

## Advantages
- Much faster than linear search (O(n) for sorted data.
- Scales well with large datasets.

## Disadvantages
- Requires the array to be sorted.
- Does not work efficiently with dynamic or unstructured datasets.
