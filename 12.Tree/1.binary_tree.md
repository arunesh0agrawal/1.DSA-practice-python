 # Intro
 - non-linear data structure
 - each node has at most two children (left, right)
 - topmost node in a binary tree is called the root
 - bottom-most nodes are called leaves

 # node structure
 - Data
 - left pointer
 - right pointer

 ```python
 # A Python class that represents
# an individual node in a Binary Tree


class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.val = key
```
